# chat-message-by-command
Hey, this is my first script, it is a very simple script.  You put in the chat the configured command, in this case, the one I put as a default is "/ck". When you type this command, what you configured in the message.lua will pop-up automatically.  How to change the command?  Once you open the message.lua, where it says, : RegisterCommand, change "ck" to the command of your like such as /help or /discord.  How to change the answer of the command?  Very simple. Inside the file (message.lua), where it says : msg. Change what is inside of  ".  You can also change the [AceptaosRP] to whatever you want like: server, system, etc.   Once said this. I have to say that I am the owner of a Spanish speaking roleplay server, and it would help if you'd joined my discord: https://discord.gg/2m7AxMw.  Thank you and I hope this simple script helps you. If you need help, you can contact me to my discord, SkyFire#0001.
